## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click **Play** on the welcome screen.
3. Type a 5-letter word using your keyboard or the on-screen keyboard.
4. Press **Enter** to submit your guess.
5. Tiles change colour based on your guess:
   - 🟩 **Green** — Letter is in the correct position.
   - 🟨 **Yellow** — Letter is in the word but wrong position.
   - ⬛ **Grey** — Letter is not in the word.
6. You have **6 attempts** to guess the word. Good luck!

## 🚀 Getting Started

No build step or server required. Just open the file:

```bash
# Option 1: Open directly in browser
open index.html

# Option 2: Serve locally (recommended to avoid any CORS issues)
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whichever port is shown).

## ⚙️ How It Works

### `Resources/answer.js`
Exports an array called `answer` — a curated list of 5-letter words. A random word is picked from this list at the start of each game.

### `Resources/guess.js`
Exports a `Set` called `validGuess` — all words the game accepts as valid guesses. If a typed word isn't in this set, it's rejected with a "Not in word list" shake animation.

### `app.js`
Handles all game logic:
- **Welcome screen** — hides on Play button click.
- **Keyboard input** — listens for physical keystrokes (`keydown` event) and on-screen key clicks.
- **Letter entry** — fills grid boxes one at a time; Backspace removes the last letter.
- **Guess validation** — checks the guess against `validGuess` before evaluating.
- **Result scoring** — uses a frequency map to correctly handle duplicate letters.
- **Colour feedback** — applied with staggered `setTimeout` delays (300ms per tile) for a flip effect.
- **Keyboard colouring** — on-screen keys are also coloured to reflect discovered letter states.
- **Win/loss detection** — shows a status message on win; reveals the answer after 6 failed attempts.
